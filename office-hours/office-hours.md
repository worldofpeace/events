## How it works
Office Hours is a call that will work in different ways depending on how you participate.

For guest speakers this is your chance to give that wider discussion you've wanted to have a space to blossom.
You could show us that new feature you're working on or open a discussion about ways we can improve our ecosystem.
For observers you get an overview of community members, their activities, standpoints on certain issues, and what is currently being worked on.

## Being a guest speaker
If you'd like to be a guest speaker in the call please reach out to the hosts
and we'll see if we can get you in the call or a future one.

## Agenda
Each call will generally be structured like this:

- Introduction from the hosts (@first 3 minutes)
- Discourse with Guest speaker/s (30 minutes)
- Q&A with audience (@last 15 minutes)

## Code Of Conduct
All participants are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct).

But at the heart of everything, please respect the following:

Be sensitive to all participants and foster an open and safe environment in any way you can, and
most especially with your use of language. Allow participants to have their chance to speak and
don't infringe on them speaking. If you're giving feedback to a participant please deliver it
respectfully, and to those who are responding to do so with grace. And lastly come prepared
to do a lot of listening and to share yourself freely.

## Volunteering
Organizing tasks are a lot of work but the outcome and
and the time we get to share together makes it all worth it. <br>
If you'd like to help out please contact @grahamc or @worldofpeace in
the appropriate channels.
