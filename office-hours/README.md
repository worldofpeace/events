## How it works
Office Hours is a call that will work in different ways depending on how you participate.

For guest speakers this is your chance to give that wider discussion you've wanted to have a space to blossom.
You could show us that new feature you're working on or open a discussion about ways we can improve our ecosystem.
For observers you get an overview of community members, their activities, standpoints on certain issues, and what is currently being worked on.
